/// \{

/// Class used for fast conversion from training text (i.e. catenated
/// non-display text of symbols; Mandarin / Super-PinYin is a bit more
/// complicated but still uses one!) into Dasher's internal "symbol" indices.
/// One of these is created for the alphabet (CAlphInfo) currently in use,
/// tho there are no restrictions on creation of CAlphabetMaps in other places
/// (Mandarin!) - or modification, if you have a non-const pointer!
///
/// Ian clearly had reservations about this system, as follows; and I'd add
/// that much of the fun comes from supporting single unicode characters
/// which are multiple octets, as we use  std::string (which works in octets)
/// for everything...note that we do *not* support multi-unicode-character
/// symbols (such as the "asdf" suggested below) except in the case of "\r\n"
/// for the paragraph symbol.
///
/// Note that in 2010 we did indeed tailor this to the alphabet more closely,
/// fast-casing single-octet characters to avoid using a hash etc. - this makes
/// many common alphabets substantially faster!
///
/// Anyway, Ian writes:
///
/// If I were just using GCC, which comes with the CGI "STL" implementation, I would
/// use hash_map (which isn't part of the ANSI/ISO standard C++ STL, but hey it's nice).
/// Using a plain map is just too slow for training on large files (or it is with certain
/// STL implementations). I'm sure training could be made much faster still, but that's
/// another matter...
/// 
/// While I could (and probably should) get a hash_map for VC++ from
/// http://www.stlport.org I thought it would be nicer if people didn't have
/// to download extra stuff and then have to get it working alongside the STL
/// with VC++, especially for just one small part of Dasher.
/// 
/// The result is this:
/// ***************************************************
/// very much thrown together to get Dasher out ASAP.
/// ***************************************************
/// It is deliberately not like an STL container.
/// However, as it has a tiny interface, it should still be easy to replace.
/// Sorry if this seems really unprofressional.
/// 
/// Replacing it might be a good idea. On the other hand it could be customised
/// to the needs of the alphabet, so that it works faster.
///
/// You can't remove items once they are added as Dasher has no need for that.
